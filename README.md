# Create-A-Movie-Trailer-Website

You will write code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailer.

### How will I complete this project?

1. If you haven't already, install Python
2. Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
3. Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
4. To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py - this module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
5. Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
